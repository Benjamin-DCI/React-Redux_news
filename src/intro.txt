Redux Thunk is a middleware used (mainly) to make asynchronous api calls

Why is this not so straightforward in React?

The answer is STATE.

1. STATE (before call)
2. STATE (during call)
3. STATE (answer received)

Generally, for any API request you want to dispatch at 
least 2 different kinds of actions ...

1. An action informing the reducers that the request has begun 

2. An action informing the reducers that the request finished successfully

Thunk allows us to return function instead of objects as an action
